        <p>Delicious and simple pan seared scallops.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 small shallot, minced</li>
            <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
            <li>12 sea scallops</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shallot; cook and stir until lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in lemon juice and cook until evaporated, scraping the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits, about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place scallops 1/2 inch apart in the skillet. Cook until browned on the bottom, about 1 minute. Flip and continue cooking until the second side is deeply browned, about 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Transfer scallops to a serving plate; season with salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley.</li>
        </ol>
