        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Taiyaki (鯛焼き) a fish-shape cake/snack filled with azuki sweet red bean paste. During the street fair and festivals, you’ll see it being cooked on a fish-shaped iron mold.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ¼ cup cake flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>¾ cup whole milk</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>5 Tbsp red bean paste</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients. You will also need a taiyaki maker. Please note that each brand of taiyaki maker comes with a different size mold, so if you are making taiyaki for the first time, consider the first time as a trial for measuring your taiyaki size and ingredients portion.</li>
            <li>Sift the cake flour, baking powder and baking soda into a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar and whisk well to combine. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg and then add the milk to combine well.</li>
            <li>Combine the dry ingredients with wet ingredients and whisk well. Keep the batter in the refrigerator for at least one hour to rest and let the flour absorb liquid. Whisking the batter creates gluten, so it’s better to let it rest to make a smooth batter.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into a measuring cup or jug. It should be 1 ¼ cup.</li>
            <li>Heat the taiyaki pan and grease the pan with vegetable oil using a brush.</li>
            <li>Fill the taiyaki pan mold about 60% full over medium-low heat.</li>
            <li>Put anko in the center of each mold and pour the batter on top to cover it. Close the lid and immediately flip.</li>
            <li>Cook for 2-2.5 minutes each side. Then flip and cook another 2-2.5 minutes. Open and check to see if taiyaki is golden brown. Let Taiyaki cool on a wire rack.</li>
        </ol>
